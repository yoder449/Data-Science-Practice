This area is a demonstration of my own practical application of SQL, Python, and data visualization studies on data sets I find interesting.

## Russo-Ukraine War 2022 Personnel Losses Analysis
Conducted 8 June 2022

**Question**: What days of the war accounted for the most percentage of Russian losses, and what insights does a Pareto analysis yield?

**Methods and Results**: [Click here](https://github.com/yoder449/Data-Science-Practice/tree/main/Russo-Ukraine%20War%202022%20Personnel%20Losses%20Analysis) to view the sample dataset, SQL query, and outputs. An SQL query was performed on the sample CSV using [SQLiteOnline's](https://sqliteonline.com/) integrated interpreter. Then, a Python script data visualization was conducted using the pyplot library, with screenshots provided of the output. The data showed that 3/3/2022 (day 8) of the conflict resulted in the most recorded Russian losses at 3,160, which accounted for approximately 10% of their total losses to date.
